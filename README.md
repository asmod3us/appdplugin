With a Phonegap plugin native code may be called from Javascript. This is an example plugin for iOS and Android that allows the AppDynamics SDK to be called from Javascript.

The latest version of the AppDynamics SDK allows for custom correlation of network requests to backend services. Ensure you are using the lastest version of the SDK if you want correlation.
